    <p>I intend to fully investigate this event and find out for myself, once and for all, whether there is actually something that can be both safe for the individual and fun for the family. If not, I would like to believe that there is a way to stop it. With your help we can come to the truth of the matter together. I hope you will join me on this journey into the sordid world of fart knocking.</p>
